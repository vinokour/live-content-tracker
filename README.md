# live-content-tracker

Welcome to the zip files of my live content twitter tracker that I worked on over the summer. 

UI is for the front end files and service is the back end. 

Apidata.py retrieved the data from the tweets for the CSV file and hello.py used FLASK to connect the back end to the front end!

Feel free to email me for more questions!
